Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Initialization Before Loop Starts
    We have three pointers:

    prev → Initially null
    current → Initially points to head
    next → Will temporarily store current.next to avoid losing the reference

    Example: Original Linked List
        head → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL

    Initially:
    prev = null, current = 1, next = null

2. First Iteration (current = 1)
    prev = null   current = 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL
    next = null
Step-by-Step Execution
    next = current.next → Store 2
    next = 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL
    current.next = prev → Reverse link (1 → null)
    prev = current → Move prev to 1
    prev = 1 → NULL
    current = next → Move current to 2
    current = 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL

3. Second Iteration (current = 2)
prev = 1 → NULL,  current = 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL

Step-by-Step Execution
    next = current.next → Store 3
    next = 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL
    current.next = prev → Reverse link (2 → 1 → NULL)
    prev = current → Move prev to 2

    prev = 2 → 1 → NULL
    current = next → Move current to 3
    current = 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL

4. Third Iteration (current = 3)
    prev = 2 → 1 → NULL,  current = 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL

Step-by-Step Execution
    next = current.next → Store 4
    next = 4 → 5 → NULL
    current.next = prev → Reverse link (3 → 2 → 1 → NULL)
    3 → 2 → 1 → NULL
    prev = current → Move prev to 3
    prev = 3 → 2 → 1 → NULL
    current = next → Move current to 4
    current = 4 → 5 → NULL
    Final Iteration (current = 5)
    After reversing all links, we reach:
    5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → NULL
    Now, current becomes null, and the loop stops.

Final Step: Update Head
Since prev now holds the new first node (5), we update the head:

this.head = prev;
Final Output
head → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → NULL
The linked list is now successfully reversed.

Let's take a simple chain of people holding hands instead of a train.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: Five Friends Holding Hands
Imagine five friends (A, B, C, D, E) standing in a line, holding hands in one direction:

A → B → C → D → E → NULL
(A is the first person, E is the last person, and NULL means no one is after E.)

Now, we want to reverse this chain so that they hold hands in the opposite direction:

E → D → C → B → A → NULL

How Do We Reverse the Chain?
We will change the direction of hand-holding step by step.

Three Things We Need
prev (previous friend) → At first, no one is before A, so it's null.
current (current friend) → Starts with A.
next (next friend) → Helps us remember the next person before breaking the chain.

Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Reverse A's Hand
        next = B (Remember B before breaking A's hand)
        A.next = prev (A lets go of B and now points to null)
        Move prev forward → prev = A
        Move current forward → current = B
        Now, the chain looks like this:

A → NULL    B → C → D → E → NULL
     ↑
   (prev)

Step 2: Reverse B's Hand
        next = C (Remember C before breaking B's hand)
        B.next = prev (B lets go of C and now points to A)
        Move prev forward → prev = B
        Move current forward → current = C
        Now, the chain looks like:

B → A → NULL    C → D → E → NULL
     ↑
   (prev)

Step 3: Reverse C's Hand
        next = D
        C.next = prev (C now points to B)
        Move prev forward → prev = C
        Move current forward → current = D
        Now, the chain looks like:

C → B → A → NULL    D → E → NULL
     ↑
   (prev)

Step 4: Reverse D's Hand
        next = E
        D.next = prev (D now points to C)
        Move prev forward → prev = D
        Move current forward → current = E
        Now, the chain looks like:

D → C → B → A → NULL    E → NULL
     ↑
   (prev)

Step 5: Reverse E's Hand (Last Step!)
        next = null (E has no one ahead)
        E.next = prev (E now points to D)
        Move prev forward → prev = E
        Move current forward → current = null (Loop ends!)

Final chain:
E → D → C → B → A → NULL
     ↑
   (prev)  → This is the new **head**

Final Step: Update the Head
Since prev is now the new first person in the line, we update:

this.head = prev;
Now, the linked list is completely reversed! ✅
