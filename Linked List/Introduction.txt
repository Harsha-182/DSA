Linked List Notes
----------------------
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. 

Each node contains:
    Data (the value stored)
    Pointer (reference to the next node)
    
Types of Linked Lists
    Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
    Doubly Linked List: Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
    Circular Linked List: The last node connects back to the first node.
